ICON INFORMATION
================

The application expects an icon.png file for the system tray.

If icon.png is not present, the application will attempt to create a default icon.
You can add your own 16x16 or 32x32 PNG icon file named "icon.png" in this folder.

For now, the application will work without an icon, but you may see a default system icon in the tray.
